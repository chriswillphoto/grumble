# **GRUMBLE**

Grumble makes food decisions easy. Forgot having multiple tabs open trying to decide where to eat, as feuds and hanger quickly sets in. Grumble allows users to sign up / log on, search the suburb they want to eat in and toggle through the options, Tinder Style - clicking No: for no thanks. Yes: for 'maybe we should eat here tonight', and heart: for favoriting.

The maybes get added to a shortlist on the user's profile page where they can read more about each restaurant, see its location on Google maps, make a comparison between venues, and ultimately decide where to eat, quickly and painlessly.
Grumble makes you look and feel efficient!

The Grumble app solves the common question of: 'where / what should we eat? We hope the answer to this question will soon be: 'I don't know, check Grumble'.
